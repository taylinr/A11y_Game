# A11y_Game


This Game is made for Website Developers. 

Since Developers often cannot see, feel or hear the difference of their code-changes we want to help them by visualizing these changes. We are clearly not able and not trying to simulate disabilities, but rather give developers without these disabilities a glimpse of which important impact their decisions in coding accessible websites have.

It is not a comprehensive tutorial on Website Accessibility but a great start to learn what is most important - keeping accessibility in mind while coding.
